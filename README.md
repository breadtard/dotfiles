# my .files
i am very original

These dots require:
Name of package | reason
--------------- | ------
picom | compositor
xbindkeys | keybind manager (because i also need some keybinds in other wms such as KWIN)
rofi | program launcher 
alacritty | terminal
feh | background thing
polybar | bar

# Troubleshooting
 hyelp wallpaper doesnt work

 you have to edit i3 config file and put path to wallpaper

 hyelp zshrc doesnt work

 you have to edit it, because it has a path to /home/someuser/

what does GREEN and BLUE mean???m

GREEN is green forest dotfiles, while BLUE is blue ice dotfiles. Shellrc and xbindkeys is outside those because its not changed between dots.
