# Green Forest .files
i am very original

These dots require:
Name of package | reason
--------------- | ------
picom | compositor
xbindkeys | keybind manager (i dont like doing them in i3 config)
dmenu | program launcher (rofi machine broke)
alacritty | terminal
feh | background thing
polybar | bar

# Troubleshooting
##hyelp wallpaper doesnt work
###you have to edit i3 config file and put path to wallpaper

##hyelp zshrc doesnt work
###you have to edit it, because it has a path to /home/someuser/
